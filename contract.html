	<h1>Quyen Kpuih WEB115-85 Course Contract</h1>
	<p>I, Quyen kpuih agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my spring 2020 WEB115-85:Web Markup and Scripting
	with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
	<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, 
	and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
	As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
	<p>Signed: Quyen kpuih, 01/14/2020</p>
	<h2>Workspace Setup</h2>
	<p>Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.</p>
